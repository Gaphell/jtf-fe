                JTF wants to help in upskilling our youths and creating a viable future for them within Bhutan, with
                their

                Our main aim is to reverse the emigration trend from Bhutan by enabling people to get high paying jobs
                within Bhutan.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also want to contribute to Bhutanâ€™s economy by acquiring overseas projects and bringing in much
                needed
                hard currency into the country.
